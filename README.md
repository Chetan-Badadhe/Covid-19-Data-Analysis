Project Overview:
To analyze and visualize Covid-19 data across different countries and time periods, with the aim of identifying trends, patterns, and key insights related to the spread, recovery, and mortality rates of the virus.

Problem Statement:
The business wanted to understand its Which Country has maximum Total cases, Deaths, Recovered & active cases, what is the trend of Confirmed Deaths Recovered Active cases, 
find 20 most effected countries, countries that are badly affected by corona,Visualize Confirmed,  Active,  Recovered , Deaths Cases(entire statistics ) of a particular country to improve inventory decisions.

Dataset Information:
-CSV files containing daily records of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries per country/region.
-It includes Country/Region, Continent, Population, TotalCases, NewCases, TotalDeaths, NewDeaths, TotalRecovered, NewRecovered, ActiveCases, SeriousCritical, WHO Region

Goal:
1. Which Country has maximum Total cases, Deaths, Recovered & active cases.
2. what is the trend of Confirmed Deaths Recovered Active cases
3. find 20 most effected countries
4. 20 countries that are badly affected by corona
5. Pie Chart Representation of stats of worst affected countries.

- since from the data USA has most number of total cases,**
- USA has most number of deaths rate.
- USA has most number of recovered cases.
- USA has most number of ActiveCases.

2] what is the trend of Confirmed Deaths Recovered Active cases.

Overall Trend: The number of confirmed deaths is steadily increasing over time.

Growth Pattern:The growth starts very slowly in early 2020 (February to March).From around April 2020 onward, the number of deaths rises more sharply.The curve continues to grow at a nearly linear to slightly exponential rate through to July 2020.

Magnitude: Compared to the other variables (like Confirmed or Recovered), the total number of deaths is significantly lower, as seen by its relatively flatter curve.
